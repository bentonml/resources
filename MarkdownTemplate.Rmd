title: "R Notebook Template"
output: 
html_document:
    theme: yeti      # other theme options available; i also like cosmo
    toc: yes         # auto-generate table of contents
    toc_float: yes   # allow table of contents to scroll with you
mode: self_contained # by default; html will have no external dependencies

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code (or write LaTeX equations) within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

When you save the notebook, an HTML file with the code and output will be saved too (click *Preview* or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

A more detailed tutorial for generating HTML files via R Markdown is available [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html) from the people at RStudio!

## Global Parameters
This is where I set global options for the code chunks in the remainder of the notebook.

Quick notes:

  1. The figure heights and widths are specified in inches.
  2. Figures generate in this document are saved in all the *dev()* formats in a directory named *notebookName_files*.
  3. You can override any of these options for an individual code chunk-- see Imports and Functions section for an example.
  
```{r global_options}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = c('pdf', 'png'), fig.path='figures/', fig.width=7, fig.height=5, dpi=300,
                      echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE)
```

## Imports and Functions
I put all library imports, constants (e.g. colorschemes, themes), and functions in this section. You can easily collapse the code chunk in the RStudio editor and remove the `echo=TRUE` to prevent printing this code to the final document.

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
# put useful libraries or functions here
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(knitr)
```

## Visualization
This is a sample code chunk and resulting plot.

```{r sample_plot, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

## Final Tips & Tricks
If the markdown isn't rendering like you expect, try adding whitespace. For example, the numbered list in the first section doesn't render correctly unless surrounded by a blank line on either side.

Inline code can be rendered like `this`. Adding 'r' will run the code segment: `length(cars)` = `r length(cars)`.

R Markdown supports LaTeX equation syntax. 
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ 

You can import existing images into the document with the following:
```
![optional caption](figures/img.png)
```
